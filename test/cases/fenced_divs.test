Fenced divs are containers for sequences of blocks, to
which an attribute can be attached.

A fenced div begins with an opening fence: a line with
three or more consecutive `:` characters, followed optionally by
a class name and optionally whitespace.

It ends with a closing fence: a line beginning with three
or more consecutive `:` characters, followed by optional
whitespace and the end of the line. The number of `:` characters
in the closing fence must be at least the number in the opening fence.

If the end of the input (or enclosing block) is encountered
before a closing fence, the fenced div is implicitly closed.

```
:::::::::: foo
Hi

> A block quote.
:::::::::::
.
<div class="foo">
<p>Hi</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A block quote.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
```

```
{#bar .foo}
:::
Hi

> A block quote.
:::::::::::::
.
<div class="foo" id="bar">
<p>Hi</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A block quote.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
```

Fenced divs may be nested.

```
{#bar .foo}
::::
Hi

::: baz
> A block quote.
:::
::::
.
<div class="foo" id="bar">
<p>Hi</p>
<div class="baz">
<blockquote>
<p>A block quote.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
```

A fenced div cannot interrupt a paragraph, without
an intervening blank line.

```
Paragraph text
::::
Hi
::::
.
<p>Paragraph text
::::
Hi
::::</p>
```

A fenced div need not have attributes or a class name.

```
::::
Hi
::::
.
<div>
<p>Hi</p>
</div>
```

The closing fence must be at least as long as the opening fence.

```
::::::::: foo
Hi
::::
.
<div class="foo">
<p>Hi
::::</p>
</div>
```

If the end of the input (or enclosing block) is encountered
before a closing fence, the fenced div is implicitly closed.

```
> :::: foo
> Hi
.
<blockquote>
<div class="foo">
<p>Hi</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
```
