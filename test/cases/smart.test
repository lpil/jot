Two hyphens form an en-dash, three an em-dash.

```
Some dashes:  em---em
en--en
em --- em
en -- en
2--3
.
<p>Some dashes:  em—em
en–en
em — em
en – en
2–3</p>
```

A sequence of more than three hyphens is
parsed as a sequence of em and/or en dashes,
with no hyphens. If possible, a homogeneous
sequence of dashes is used (so, 10 hyphens
= 5 en dashes, and 9 hyphens = 3 em dashes).
When a heterogeneous sequence must be used,
the em dashes come first, followed by the en
dashes, and as few en dashes as possible are
used (so, 7 hyphens = 2 em dashes an 1 en
dash).

Hyphens can be escaped:

```
Escaped hyphens: \-- \-\-\-.

<p>Escaped hyphens: -- ---.</p>
